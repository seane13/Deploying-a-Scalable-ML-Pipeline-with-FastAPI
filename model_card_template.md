# Model Card

Use this template to document your project's model card. A model card is a structured document that provides essential information about a trained machine learning model, including details about its evaluation metrics, intended uses, limitations, and ethical considerations.

## Model Details
- **Model Type**: (e.g., Random Forest Classifier)
- **Model Version / Date Trained**: (e.g., 2025-08-10)
- **Framework**: (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Model Artifacts**: (e.g., model/model.pkl, model/encoder.pkl)
- **Training environment**: (e.g., Python 3.10, scikit-learn 1.5)

## Intended Use
Describe the purpose of the model and its expected real-world applications.

## Out-of-scope Use
List applications for which the model is not intended (e.g., high-stakes decision-making).

## Training Data
- **Source**: (e.g., UCI Adult Income dataset)
- **Features**: (e.g., age, workclass, education)
- **Data Splitting Method**: (e.g., train/test split, cross-validation)
- **Preprocessing and Cleaning**

## Evaluation Data
Explain how the evaluation dataset was prepared and how it's different from the training data.

## Metrics
- Describe the evaluation metrics used (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy).
- Provide overall model performance metrics.
- Include slice-based evaluation methods if applicable (e.g., by category, gender).

## Ethical & Fairness Considerations
Notes about fairness, bias, sensitive features, and any assessments performed.

## Caveats and Recommendations
Known limitations of the model and any relevant caveats.

## Decision Threshold and Calibration
Explain how thresholds are set (if applicable) and whether the model was calibrated.

## Reproducibility
Instructions for reproducing the results (e.g., how to run training, CI requirements).

## Maintenance & Monitoring (Optional)
Recommendations for model versioning, drift detection, retraining, and monitoring.
